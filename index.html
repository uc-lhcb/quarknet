      <h2>About LHCb and CERN</h2>
      <p>The Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is one of the four main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is designed to study the slight differences between matter and antimatter by investigating a type of particle called the "beauty quark" or "b quark".</p>
      <p>CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. It is home to the LHC, the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, which enables scientists to explore the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern them.</p>
      <p>As an intern in this program, you will have the unique opportunity to analyze real data from the LHCb experiment and contribute to the cutting-edge research conducted at CERN. You will gain valuable experience in data analysis, particle physics, and scientific collaboration while working alongside physicists from UC.</p>
